# ComfyUI IPAdapter plus
[ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) reference implementation for [IPAdapter](https://github.com/tencent-ailab/IP-Adapter/) models.

The IPAdapter are very powerful models for image-to-image conditioning. The subject or even just the style of the reference image(s) can be easily transferred to a generation. Think of it as a 1-image lora.

## Important updates

**2024/04/09**: Added experimental Style/Composition transfer for SD1.5. The results are often not as good as SDXL. Optimal weight seems to be from 0.8 to 2.0. The **Style+Composition node doesn't work for SD1.5** at the moment, you can only alter either the Style or the Composition, I need more time for testing. Old workflows will still work **but you may need to refresh the page and re-select the weight type!**

**2024/04/04**: Added Style & Composition node. It's now possible to apply both Style and Composition from the same node

**2024/04/01**: Added Composition only transfer weight type for SDXL

**2024/03/27**: Added Style transfer weight type for SDXL

**2024/03/23**: Complete code rewrite!. **This is a breaking update!** Your previous workflows won't work and you'll need to recreate them. You've been warned! After the update, refresh your browser, delete the old IPAdapter nodes and create the new ones.

*(I removed all previous updates because they were about the previous version of the extension)*

## Example workflows

The [examples directory](./examples/) has many workflows that cover all IPAdapter functionalities.

## Installation

Download or git clone this repository inside `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` directory or use the Manager. IPAdapter always requires the latest version of ComfyUI. If something doesn't work be sure to upgrade. Beware that the automatic update of the manager sometimes doesn't work and you may need to upgrade manually.

There's now a *Unified Model Loader*, for it to work you need to name the files exactly as described below. The legacy loaders work with any file name but you have to select them manually. The models can be placed into sub-directories.

Remember you can also use any custom location setting an `ipadapter` entry in the `extra_model_paths.yaml` file.

- `/ComfyUI/models/clip_vision`
    - [CLIP-ViT-H-14-laion2B-s32B-b79K.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter/resolve/main/models/image_encoder/model.safetensors), download and rename

**FaceID** models require `insightface`, you need to install it in your ComfyUI environment. Check [this issue](https://github.com/cubiq/ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus/issues/162) for help. Remember that most FaceID models also need a LoRA.

For the Unified Loader to work the files need to be named exactly as shown below.

- `/ComfyUI/models/ipadapter`
    - [ip-adapter-faceid_sd15.bin](https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter-FaceID/resolve/main/ip-adapter-faceid_sd15.bin), base FaceID model
    - [ip-adapter-faceid-plusv2_sd15.bin](https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter-FaceID/resolve/main/ip-adapter-faceid-plusv2_sd15.bin), FaceID plus v2
    - [ip-adapter-faceid-portrait-v11_sd15.bin](https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter-FaceID/resolve/main/ip-adapter-faceid-portrait-v11_sd15.bin), text prompt style transfer for portraits
    - [ip-adapter-faceid_sdxl.bin](https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter-FaceID/resolve/main/ip-adapter-faceid_sdxl.bin), SDXL base FaceID
    - [ip-adapter-faceid-plusv2_sdxl.bin](https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter-FaceID/resolve/main/ip-adapter-faceid-plusv2_sdxl.bin), SDXL plus v2
    - [ip-adapter-faceid-portrait_sdxl.bin](https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter-FaceID/resolve/main/ip-adapter-faceid-portrait_sdxl.bin), SDXL text prompt style transfer
    - **Deprecated** [ip-adapter-faceid-plus_sd15.bin](https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter-FaceID/resolve/main/ip-adapter-faceid-plus_sd15.bin), FaceID plus v1 
    - **Deprecated** [ip-adapter-faceid-portrait_sd15.bin](https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter-FaceID/resolve/main/ip-adapter-faceid-portrait_sd15.bin), v1 of the portrait model

Most FaceID models require a LoRA. If you use the `IPAdapter Unified Loader FaceID` it will be loaded automatically if you follow the naming convention. Otherwise you have to load them manually, be careful each FaceID model has to be paired with its own specific LoRA.

- `/ComfyUI/models/loras`
    - [ip-adapter-faceid_sd15_lora.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter-FaceID/resolve/main/ip-adapter-faceid_sd15_lora.safetensors)
    - [ip-adapter-faceid-plusv2_sd15_lora.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter-FaceID/resolve/main/ip-adapter-faceid-plusv2_sd15_lora.safetensors)
    - [ip-adapter-faceid_sdxl_lora.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter-FaceID/resolve/main/ip-adapter-faceid_sdxl_lora.safetensors), SDXL FaceID LoRA
    - [ip-adapter-faceid-plusv2_sdxl_lora.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter-FaceID/resolve/main/ip-adapter-faceid-plusv2_sdxl_lora.safetensors), SDXL plus v2 LoRA
    - **Deprecated** [ip-adapter-faceid-plus_sd15_lora.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter-FaceID/resolve/main/ip-adapter-faceid-plus_sd15_lora.safetensors), LoRA for the deprecated FaceID plus v1 model

All models can be found on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/h94).

### Community's models

The community has baked some interesting IPAdapter models.

- `/ComfyUI/models/ipadapter`
    - [ip_plus_composition_sd15.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/ostris/ip-composition-adapter/resolve/main/ip_plus_composition_sd15.safetensors), general composition ignoring style and content, more about it [here](https://huggingface.co/ostris/ip-composition-adapter)
    - [ip_plus_composition_sdxl.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/ostris/ip-composition-adapter/resolve/main/ip_plus_composition_sdxl.safetensors), SDXL version

if you know of other models please let me know and I will add them to the unified loader.

## Generic suggestions

There are many workflows included in the [examples](./examples/) directory. Please check them before asking for support.

Usually it's a good idea to lower the `weight` to at least `0.8` and increase the number steps. To increase adherece to the prompt you may try to change the **weight type** in the `IPAdapter Advanced` node.

## Nodes reference

I'm (slowly) documenting all nodes. Please check the [Nodes reference](./NODES.md).

## Troubleshooting

Please check the [troubleshooting](https://github.com/cubiq/ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus/issues/108) before posting a new issue. Also remember to check the previous closed issues.
